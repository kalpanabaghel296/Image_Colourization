# Image Colorization using Deep Learning (U-Net)

This project automatically colorizes grayscale (black & white) images using a Deep Learning model based on U-Net architecture. The model predicts color channels from grayscale input images to generate realistic colorized outputs.

## Project Features

- Image colorization using U-Net architecture
- Uses LAB color space for better color prediction
- GPU (CUDA) support for faster training
- Dataset handling with corrupted image skipping
- Training checkpoint saving
- Dataset size control for fast experimentation
- Model evaluation using MSE
- Clean modular code structure

## Dataset

This project uses COCO 2017 Dataset.

Because the dataset is very large, it is NOT included in this repository.

Download manually from:
https://cocodataset.org

Use the training images folder:
train2017/

*Model Architecture*
Encoder: Feature extraction
Bottleneck: Deep representation
Decoder: Reconstruction
Skip Connections: Preserve edges and details

*Loss Function*
Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss is used to match predicted color channels to true colors.

*Evaluation Metrics*
MSE (Mean Squared Error)

*Hardware Recommendation*
GPU: NVIDIA CUDA GPU recommended
CPU training possible but slow
